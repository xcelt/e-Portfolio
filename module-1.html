								<p>
								<blockquote>Discuss why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for
									companies to invest in Cyber Security.</blockquote>
								</p>

							<p>
								An organisation that becomes a global leader and investor in cybersecurity has a
								competitive edge, as being resilient to cyber-attacks is economically beneficial. The
								Economic Impact of Cybercrime global report uncovers that the potential annual global
								cost of cybercrime could reach approximately $600 billion (Lewis, 2018).
							</p>
							<p>
								Threat profiling in "the gray zone", where the violation of public-private, foreign or
								domestic legal boundaries is not apparent, is a challenge (Sheppard & Conklin, 2019).
								Since 19 May 2022, US "white hat hackers" accessing a computer for "good faith security
								research" are no longer punished, although the interpretation of "good faith" is
								criticised as subjective and "ambiguous" (Coker, 2022; Department of Justice, 2022).
							</p>
							<p>
								In worm attacks, data encrypted by malicious actors may be unrecoverable even if the
								ransom has been paid. In 2017, the WannaCry worm used the EternalBlue vulnerability
								which disrupted the car production of Renault-Nissan, a multinational company and many
								of Britain's National Health Service emergency services became non-operational, until a
								"kill switch" was found. (Anderson, 2020) The downtime of critical services leaves a
								devastating impact on the company's reputation and its stakeholders' trust - especially
								involving "functional safety systems such as Schneider electric products", as noted by
								James Hines. Time impact is the greatest for large companies, from the extra capacity
								needed to make up for lost productivity and in handling the breaches (Cyber Security
								Breaches Survey, 2019).
							</p>
							<p>
								Security awareness and education are essential. The least careful staff with privileged
								access determines how secure an organisation is (VanSyckel, 2018). As Laura Saxton
								mentioned, companies may not prioritise a security incident "proactive response policy"
								in place of "a reactive one" (2022). Threat actors are less likely to attack an
								expensive target (Borg, 2018). Establishing defensive strategies along with an incident
								recovery process to mitigate and isolate threats and performing regular backups are
								highly recommended as industry practices. Keeping up-to-date with the security releases
								and latest patches of software systems minimises the risk of known vulnerabilities
								exposure, saving long-term hidden costs. (Anderson, 2020)

									<h3>Introduction</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Unprotected networks are insecure, being easy targets that are vulnerable to
									threats. Multilayered network security, such as early detection via an Intrusion
									Detection System (IDS), is crucial in protecting systems and environments from
									various threats at different levels. Furthermore, establishing a Security Incident
									and Event Management (SIEM) solution to handle unprecedented incidents well
									mitigates the consequences in the event of a potential breach.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The goal of an IDS is to detect malicious network activity through misuse or
									anomalies. Two approaches to IDS are signature-based and anomaly-based detections
									(Hines, 2022). Antivirus software, a widely marketed IDS solution, scans for
									indicators of compromise (IoC) from virus data patterns or signatures (Anderson,
									2020). IDS is applicable in security operations - monitoring the traffic origin,
									access and system logs, detecting changes or deviations in data known as outliers
									and anomalies, ruling them out as suspicious activity.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM)</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The SIEM is a centralised platform derived from the concept of Security Information
									Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM) (Esseghir et al., 2022). The
									SIEM gathers real-time events from a variety of sensors, which includes capturing
									session packets from malicious connections and events for network forensics
									(González-Granadillo et al., 2021). Given a set of rules, the SIEM parses, groups
									and synthesises the signals into meaningful insights for further analysis by the
									security operations team, especially during security incidents.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									A combination of the use of IDS to detect anomalies in network traffic and the SIEM
									to respond to alerts is key to protecting and securing networks and systems, which
									is my affirmative response to Laura Saxton's question of whether both should be used
									in tandem (2022). A distinguishing factor in effectively managing security incidents
									is the adaptability of existing security solutions for different industrial use
									cases.
